# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm [Jayodya Methmal](https://jayodya-methmal.netlify.app/#about)

## About Me
I am a cybersecurity undergraduate with a strong passion for advanced ethical hacking and web development. Proficient in React.js, Node.js, Express, and Next.js, I specialize in building robust web applications.

My skill set includes extensive knowledge of tools like Nmap, Metasploit, Wireshark, John the Ripper, and Burp Suite, bolstered by experience with Packet Tracer, Eve-Ng, and Tenable NessusÂ®. Additionally, I am well-versed in programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and have expertise in ReactJS, SCSS (Sass), Node.js, Express, MySQL, and the NetBeans IDE.

With my comprehensive skills and enthusiasm for both cybersecurity and web development, I am well-prepared to contribute effectively to projects in these fields.
